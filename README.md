My solution : https://matbac85.github.io/AgeCalculatorApp/

## Age calculator app using Vue 3 Composition API
This is a simple web application built with Vue 3 and the Composition API that allows users to submit their birth date to know their exact age (in years, months and days).

## Features

The users should be able to: 

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted
