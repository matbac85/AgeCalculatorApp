## Overview

This age calculator app was developed as a solution to the Frontend Mentor challenge. The challenge required building an app that calculates age in years, months, and days based on the date submitted through a form. The app should closely match the provided design and include validation for the form fields.

## Features

- Users can view an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form.
- Validation errors are displayed for empty fields, invalid day and month numbers, future dates, and invalid dates.
- Users can view the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size.
- Hover and focus states are implemented for all interactive elements on the page.
- **Bonus**: Age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted.
